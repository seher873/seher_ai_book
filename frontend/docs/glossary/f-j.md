# F-J Terms

## Feature Engineering

**Definition**: The process of selecting and transforming variables when creating a predictive model using machine learning.

**Examples**:
- Creating dummy variables from categorical data
- Normalizing numerical features
- Creating polynomial features

## Fine-tuning

**Definition**: A transfer learning technique where a pre-trained model is adapted to a specific task by training on a smaller, task-specific dataset.

**Examples**:
- Adapting a pre-trained language model for sentiment analysis
- Customizing a computer vision model for medical imaging
- Adjusting a model for domain-specific applications

## Forward Propagation

**Definition**: The process of calculating the output of a neural network by passing input data through the network layers.

**Examples**:
- Computing predictions during inference
- Calculating activations during training
- Evaluating model performance

## Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)

**Definition**: A class of machine learning frameworks where two neural networks compete against each other to generate new data.

**Examples**:
- Creating realistic images from text descriptions
- Generating synthetic data for training
- Style transfer applications

## Gradient Descent

**Definition**: An optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent.

**Examples**:
- Updating neural network weights during training
- Finding optimal parameters in machine learning models
- Optimizing model performance

## Hyperparameter

**Definition**: Parameters that are set before the training process begins, unlike model parameters which are learned during training.

**Examples**:
- Learning rate
- Number of layers in a neural network
- Batch size
- Regularization parameters

## Inference

**Definition**: The process of using a trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data.

**Examples**:
- Classifying new images with a trained CNN
- Translating text with a trained language model
- Predicting customer behavior with a trained model

## Jacobian Matrix

**Definition**: A matrix of all first-order partial derivatives of a vector-valued function.

**Examples**:
- Used in neural network optimization
- Applied in sensitivity analysis
- Used in backpropagation algorithms
