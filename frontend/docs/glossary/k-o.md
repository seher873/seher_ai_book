# K-O Terms

## Knowledge Graph

**Definition**: A structured representation of knowledge that describes relationships between entities in a graph format.

**Examples**:
- Used by search engines to enhance search results
- Representing relationships in semantic web
- Supporting question answering systems

## Latent Space

**Definition**: A lower-dimensional space in which data is represented in a compressed form, often used in generative models and dimensionality reduction.

**Examples**:
- Variational autoencoders
- Generative adversarial networks
- Principal component analysis

## Loss Function

**Definition**: A function that measures the difference between predicted and actual values, used to guide model training.

**Examples**:
- Mean squared error for regression
- Cross-entropy for classification
- Custom loss functions for specific tasks

## Machine Learning

**Definition**: A field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed.

**Examples**:
- Recommendation systems
- Fraud detection
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

**Definition**: A branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret, and generate human language.

**Examples**:
- Chatbots and virtual assistants
- Language translation
- Sentiment analysis
- Text summarization

## Overfitting

**Definition**: A modeling error that occurs when a function is too closely aligned to a limited set of data points, leading to poor generalization.

**Examples**:
- High training accuracy but low validation accuracy
- Complex models on small datasets
- Models that memorize training data

## Precision

**Definition**: A metric that measures the accuracy of positive predictions in a classification model.

**Examples**:
- Proportion of relevant items among retrieved results
- Important in information retrieval systems
- Trade-off with recall in model evaluation

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

**Definition**: A dimensionality reduction technique that transforms data into a set of orthogonal components that explain the maximum variance.

**Examples**:
- Data visualization in lower dimensions
- Feature reduction in machine learning
- Noise filtering in signal processing
