# P-T Terms

## Pre-trained Model

**Definition**: A model that has been previously trained on a large dataset and can be used as a starting point for a related task.

**Examples**:
- BERT for natural language tasks
- ResNet for image recognition
- GPT models for text generation

## Prompt Engineering

**Definition**: The practice of designing and refining inputs to guide large language models to produce desired outputs.

**Examples**:
- Crafting specific instructions for text generation
- Optimizing queries for better responses
- Developing effective interaction patterns with AI models

## Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

**Definition**: A class of artificial neural networks designed for sequential data, where connections form a directed graph along a temporal sequence.

**Examples**:
- Language modeling
- Time series prediction
- Speech recognition

## Regularization

**Definition**: Techniques used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the loss function based on model complexity.

**Examples**:
- L1 regularization (Lasso)
- L2 regularization (Ridge)
- Dropout in neural networks

## Reinforcement Learning

**Definition**: A type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.

**Examples**:
- Game playing AI
- Robot control
- Resource management optimization

## Residual Network (ResNet)

**Definition**: A deep learning architecture that uses skip connections to enable training of very deep networks.

**Examples**:
- Image classification tasks
- Object detection systems
- Medical image analysis

## Semantic Segmentation

**Definition**: A computer vision task that involves classifying each pixel in an image into a class, creating a pixel-wise mask.

**Examples**:
- Autonomous vehicle perception
- Medical image analysis
- Scene understanding

## Transformer

**Definition**: A deep learning model architecture that uses self-attention mechanisms to process sequential data in parallel.

**Examples**:
- BERT and GPT models for NLP
- Vision transformers for image tasks
- Speech recognition systems
