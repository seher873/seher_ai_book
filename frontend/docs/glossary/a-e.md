# A-E Terms

## Activation Function

**Definition**: A mathematical function that determines the output of a node in a neural network based on its input or set of inputs.

**Examples**:
- Sigmoid function
- ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)
- Tanh function

## Algorithm

**Definition**: A step-by-step procedure for calculations, often used in machine learning to train models or make predictions.

**Examples**:
- Linear regression
- Decision trees
- K-means clustering

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)

**Definition**: The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction.

**Examples**:
- Image recognition systems
- Natural language processing
- Expert systems

**Synonyms**: 
- Machine intelligence
- Computational intelligence

## Backpropagation

**Definition**: A method used in artificial neural networks to calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to weights.

**Examples**:
- Used to train deep learning models
- Enables efficient weight updates during training

## Bias

**Definition**: In machine learning, bias refers to the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem by a simplified model.

**Examples**:
- High bias can lead to underfitting
- Low bias models can be more complex and flexible

## Classification

**Definition**: A type of supervised learning where the output variable is categorical rather than continuous.

**Examples**:
- Email spam detection
- Image recognition
- Medical diagnosis

## Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

**Definition**: A class of deep neural networks, most commonly used in image analysis.

**Examples**:
- Image classification
- Object detection
- Face recognition

## Cross-Entropy

**Definition**: A loss function commonly used in classification tasks that measures the difference between two probability distributions.

**Examples**:
- Used in multiclass image classification
- Used in natural language processing tasks

## Data Augmentation

**Definition**: A technique for increasing the size and diversity of a training dataset by creating modified versions of existing data.

**Examples**:
- Rotating, flipping, or cropping images
- Adding noise to audio samples
- Synonym replacement in text

## Deep Learning

**Definition**: A subset of machine learning based on artificial neural networks with representation learning.

**Examples**:
- Computer vision applications
- Natural language processing
- Autonomous vehicles
