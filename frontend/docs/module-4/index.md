# Module 4: LLMs + Robotics: Voice-to-Action Systems

## Overview

Welcome to Module 4 of the Physical AI textbook, focusing on LLMs integrated with robotics for voice-to-action systems. This module will guide you through converting natural language commands into ROS 2-based robotic actions including perception, navigation, and manipulation.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and their applications
- Convert voice commands to text for robotic processing
- Decompose natural language commands into executable robotic actions
- Understand multimodal perception systems
- Implement ROS 2 planning and execution for voice commands
- Build a complete capstone autonomous humanoid system

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic knowledge of robotics concepts
- Understanding of ROS/ROS2 fundamentals
- Basic understanding of LLMs and NLP concepts

## Module Structure

This module is organized into six chapters:

1. **Intro VLA**: Introduction to Vision-Language-Action models
2. **Speech-to-Text**: Converting voice commands to text
3. **Task Decomposition**: Breaking down NL commands into executable actions
4. **Multimodal Perception**: Understanding combined sensory inputs
5. **ROS 2 Planning & Execution**: Converting plans to robotic actions
6. **Capstone Autonomous Humanoid**: Complete integration example
