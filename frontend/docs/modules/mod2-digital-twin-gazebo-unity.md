# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Module Overview

This module explores the concept of digital twins in robotics, focusing on two leading simulation platforms: Gazebo and Unity. A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical system that enables testing, validation, and optimization of robotic behaviors in a risk-free environment. This approach significantly reduces development time and cost while improving safety and reliability.

Gazebo and Unity offer complementary strengths for creating digital twins. Gazebo provides realistic physics simulation and sensor modeling ideal for traditional robotics applications, while Unity's graphics capabilities and ML-Agents toolkit excel at creating complex environments and training AI agents. Together, they form a comprehensive simulation ecosystem for robotics development.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

1. Understand the digital twin concept and its role in robotics development
2. Set up and configure both Gazebo and Unity environments for robotics simulation
3. Create accurate robot models in both simulation platforms
4. Implement sensor simulation and physics modeling for realistic environments
5. Perform sim-to-real transfer of robotic behaviors
6. Utilize Unity's ML-Agents toolkit for reinforcement learning
7. Compare strengths and weaknesses of Gazebo vs Unity for different applications
8. Apply domain randomization techniques to improve model robustness
