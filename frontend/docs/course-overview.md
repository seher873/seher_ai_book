# Course Overview - Physical AI

## Introduction

Welcome to the Physical AI course, an interdisciplinary exploration of Artificial Intelligence in physical systems. This course bridges the gap between traditional AI concepts and their physical embodiment in robotic systems, providing students with the knowledge and skills to develop intelligent agents that interact with the physical world.

Physical AI, also known as embodied AI, represents a convergence of machine learning, robotics, computer vision, and natural language processing to create systems that perceive, reason, and act in three-dimensional physical environments. This field has gained significant momentum as advances in computational power, sensing technologies, and learning algorithms have enabled robots to operate more autonomously and intelligently in challenging real-world environments.

Throughout this course, you will explore how intelligent systems can effectively interact with the physical world, learning both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of AI-powered physical systems. You'll engage with concepts ranging from perception and navigation to learning from demonstration and human-robot interaction.

## Why Physical AI Matters

Physical AI represents one of the most exciting frontiers in artificial intelligence, with profound implications for society, industry, and science. Understanding Physical AI is crucial for several reasons:
