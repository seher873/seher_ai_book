# Introduction to AI Quiz

## Question 1
What is artificial intelligence?

A) Creating machines that can think and learn like humans
B) Programming computers to follow explicit instructions
C) Building faster processors
D) Optimizing existing algorithms

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:** Artificial intelligence is about creating machines that can think and learn like humans, typically through algorithms that can recognize patterns, make decisions, and improve from experience.

## Question 2
Which of the following is a common application of machine learning?

A) Predictive analytics
B) Sorting algorithms
C) Database management
D) Web design

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:** Predictive analytics is a major application of machine learning where models are trained to make predictions based on historical data.

## Question 3
What does "supervised learning" refer to?

A) Learning with labeled training data
B) Learning without any training data
C) Learning by observing other algorithms
D) Learning through trial and error

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:** Supervised learning uses labeled training data to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs.

## Question 4
In neural networks, what is a "layer"?

A) A collection of neurons that process information in parallel
B) A single neuron with multiple outputs
C) A type of activation function
D) A data storage unit

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:** A layer in a neural network is a collection of neurons that process information in parallel from the previous layer.

## Question 5
What is overfitting in machine learning?

A) When a model performs well on training data but poorly on test data
B) When a model takes too long to train
C) When a model requires too much memory
D) When a model cannot learn from data

**Correct Answer: A**

**Explanation:** Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise and outliers, which hurts its performance on unseen data.
