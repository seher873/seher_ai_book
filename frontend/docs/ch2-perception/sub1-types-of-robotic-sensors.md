# Chapter 2: Robot Perception Systems

## Introduction

Robot perception systems form the sensory foundation that enables robots to understand and interact with their environment. These systems are critical for physical AI applications, as they provide the essential input needed for decision-making, planning, and control. In this chapter, we'll explore the various sensors robots use, how they process sensory data, and the fundamental techniques for interpreting environmental information.

Robot perception encompasses multiple modalities: visual (cameras), depth (LiDAR, stereo vision), inertial (IMU), tactile (force/torque sensors), and more. Each modality provides unique information about the environment, and the challenge lies in effectively processing and combining these sensory inputs to build a coherent understanding of the world.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Explain how robots perceive their environment using various sensors
- Understand the fundamental principles behind different sensor types
- Process camera and LiDAR data to extract meaningful environmental information
- Describe basic sensor fusion techniques
- Implement basic computer vision algorithms for robot perception
- Understand calibration and preprocessing requirements for sensor data

## Chapter Overview

This chapter is organized to provide both theoretical understanding and practical implementation knowledge. We start with an overview of different types of robotic sensors, then dive into specific technologies like camera systems and LiDAR. We'll explore sensor fusion to combine information from multiple sensors, and conclude with practical aspects like calibration and data preprocessing.

Throughout this chapter, we'll use examples from ROS2 and common robotics platforms to illustrate concepts with real implementations.
