# My AI Book Constitution: Phase-3 RAG Chatbot

## Core Principles

### I. Retrieval Accuracy (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All responses generated by the RAG chatbot must be grounded in accurate, verified information from the textbook content. The system must clearly distinguish between retrieved information and generated responses, with proper citation of sources. Any uncertainty in retrieved information must be explicitly communicated to the user, with disambiguation when multiple sources conflict.

### II. Conversational Clarity
The chatbot interface must provide clear, understandable responses that align with the educational tone of the textbook. Complex technical concepts should be explained in accessible language while preserving technical accuracy. The bot must handle ambiguous queries gracefully, asking for clarification when needed rather than providing potentially incorrect information.

### III. Ethical AI Interaction
The chatbot must embody responsible AI principles, avoiding harmful, biased, or inappropriate responses. The system must respect user privacy, not retaining or logging personal information unnecessarily. Transparency about the bot's limitations and capabilities must be maintained, with clear acknowledgment when the bot encounters questions outside its knowledge scope.

### IV. Contextual Understanding
The RAG system must maintain coherent conversation context while accurately retrieving relevant information from the textbook corpus. The bot should recognize and respond to follow-up questions that reference previous parts of the conversation. Multi-turn dialogues must be handled with consistency and logical flow.

### V. Educational Enhancement
The chatbot must serve as an effective educational tool that supplements, not replaces, the textbook content. Responses should encourage deeper exploration of topics, referencing specific chapters, exercises, or examples from the textbook. The bot should guide users toward relevant sections for comprehensive understanding.

### VI. System Reliability
The RAG chatbot must maintain consistent availability and response times that enable productive learning experiences. Error handling must be graceful, with helpful messages when technical issues occur. The system must be resilient to various user inputs while maintaining safety and accuracy standards.

## Quality Standards

The RAG system must achieve high precision in information retrieval and relevance of responses, with continuous monitoring and improvement mechanisms. Technical components must be well-documented and maintainable, with proper testing of all features. The interface must be intuitive and provide a positive user experience that encourages continued interaction.

## Development Workflow

All RAG system implementations must undergo rigorous testing with sample queries covering textbook content breadth and depth. The retrieval system must be validated for accuracy against the full corpus, with regular assessment of retrieved information quality. User experience testing must be conducted with target audience members to ensure educational effectiveness.

## Governance

This constitution governs all development, deployment, and maintenance activities for the RAG Chatbot system. All contributors must affirm understanding of these principles before participating. Changes to this constitution require consensus among core maintainers and must consider impact on the existing textbook content and user experience. Regular compliance reviews ensure adherence to stated principles.
