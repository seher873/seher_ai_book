# My AI Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Content Accuracy (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All AI-related content must be factually accurate, properly sourced, and reviewed by subject matter experts before publication. Information must be current, citing recent research and industry developments. All claims about AI capabilities must be supported by evidence and distinguish between theoretical possibilities and demonstrated realities.

### II. Educational Clarity
Content must be structured pedagogically with clear learning objectives, progressive complexity, and practical examples. Abstract concepts should be explained using accessible analogies and visual aids. Each chapter must include exercises, summaries, and next-step connections to maintain educational coherence.

### III. Ethical Responsibility
AI ethics must be woven throughout all content, addressing bias, privacy, transparency, and societal impacts of AI systems. Discussions of AI applications must include ethical considerations, potential negative consequences, and mitigation strategies. Responsible AI development practices should be emphasized over purely technical capabilities.

### IV. Practical Application
Theoretical knowledge must be paired with hands-on examples, code samples, and realistic use cases. All concepts should be demonstrated through concrete implementations that readers can reproduce. Chapters must bridge the gap between academic understanding and industry application.

### V. Continuous Updates
AI is a rapidly evolving field, requiring regular content updates to maintain relevance and accuracy. The book structure must accommodate new developments, with clear versioning and change logs. Deprecated approaches should be clearly marked with current alternatives highlighted.

### VI. Accessibility and Inclusion
Content must be accessible to diverse audiences regardless of background, with clear language and supportive learning materials. Different learning styles should be accommodated through varied presentation formats (text, diagrams, code, exercises). Inclusive examples and case studies should be prioritized.

## Quality Standards

Content must meet high editorial standards with consistent terminology, proper citations, and professional formatting. Technical content must be verified for correctness and reproducibility. All code examples should be tested against current library versions and include error handling guidance.

## Development Workflow

All contributions must undergo technical review by domain experts and editorial review for consistency with style guidelines. Major content changes require outline approval before full implementation. Peer review and reader feedback mechanisms must be established for continuous improvement.

## Governance

This constitution governs all content creation, review, and maintenance activities for the My AI Book project. All contributors must affirm understanding of these principles before participating. Changes to this constitution require consensus among core maintainers and must consider impact on all existing content. Regular compliance reviews ensure adherence to stated principles.

## Appendix C: Chatbot & RAG Constitution (Phase-2)

This section applies exclusively to the chatbot and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) functionality of the My AI Book project, introduced in Phase-2.

### I. Textbook Authority (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
The textbook content serves as the primary and authoritative source for all chatbot responses. The RAG system must prioritize textbook content over any other information sources when generating responses. All responses must be grounded in the documented content of the textbook.

### II. Response Accuracy (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All responses generated by the chatbot must be factually accurate and consistent with textbook content. The RAG system must accurately retrieve and synthesize information from approved sources only, with clear attribution to original content. Hallucinations and factual errors are unacceptable and must be prevented through rigorous validation mechanisms.

### III. Mandatory Source Citation
Every response from the chatbot must include proper citations referencing the specific chapter and section numbers from the textbook where the information is sourced. Citations must be formatted consistently and clearly indicate the original location of the information within the textbook.

### IV. Out-of-Scope Handling
When a user asks questions outside the scope of the textbook content, the chatbot must explicitly refuse to answer and direct the user to the relevant textbook material or acknowledge that the topic falls outside the book's coverage. The system must clearly differentiate between what is covered in the textbook versus external topics.

### V. Data Access and Security
The RAG system has read-only access to book content with no content mutation rights. It must not modify, store, or transmit any copyrighted material beyond what is necessary for immediate response generation. All interactions must respect privacy and security boundaries, ensuring user data is protected and content is accessed only for legitimate educational purposes.

### VI. Contextual Understanding
The chatbot must maintain context across conversations while respecting user privacy and data protection regulations. Conversational threads should be appropriately managed to provide coherent, multi-turn interactions that enhance the learning experience.

### VII. Educational Enhancement
Chatbot interactions must complement and reinforce the pedagogical approach established in the textbook content. Responses should guide users toward deeper exploration of topics, suggest relevant sections of the book, and encourage critical thinking rather than simply providing answers.

### VIII. Ethical AI Interaction
The system must incorporate guardrails to prevent misuse and ensure responsible AI engagement. Conversations should be monitored for adherence to ethical guidelines, with appropriate controls to prevent harmful, biased, or inappropriate responses.

### IX. Performance and Reliability
The RAG system must provide timely, responsive interactions with minimal latency. System reliability and uptime must meet educational standards, with appropriate fallback mechanisms when retrieval or generation fails.

### X. Privacy and Data Protection
User interactions with the chatbot must comply with applicable privacy laws and data protection regulations. Personal information must be handled securely, with transparent policies about data collection, usage, and retention.

### CHATBOT INTEGRATION ###
“Appendix C (Phase-2): Any integrated RAG chatbot shall operate strictly as a read-only, book-first system, answering queries exclusively from the textbook corpus or user-selected text, with mandatory source citation, zero hallucination tolerance, no content mutation rights, and no authority to override or modify Phase-1 textbook content.”
