## Response snapshot

Successfully executed the implementation planning workflow for Module 2 Content Generation. Here's what was accomplished:

## Summary of Planning Activities

1. **Setup and Context Loading**: Retrieved paths and loaded feature spec, constitution, and plan template as required.

2. **Technical Context Filled**: Identified all necessary technical aspects and marked unknowns as "NEEDS CLARIFICATION".

3. **Constitution Check Performed**: Verified that the planned implementation aligns with the project's core principles (Content Accuracy, Educational Clarity, Ethical Responsibility, etc.).

4. **Phase 0 - Research**: Created research.md resolving all "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" items:
   - Selected Node.js v18+ for compatibility with Docusaurus
   - Identified primary dependencies: Docusaurus v3.x, React, Markdown/CommonMark, Git integration
   - Decided on storage approach: File system (Markdown files) with Git version control
   - Chose testing libraries: Jest and React Testing Library
   - Confirmed target platform: Web-based educational platform

5. **Phase 1 - Design & Contracts**:
   - Created detailed data model (data-model.md) with entities: Module 2 Content, Learning Objectives, Assessment, User, and Chapter
   - Generated API contracts in OpenAPI format (contracts/api-spec.yaml)
   - Created quickstart guide for developers (quickstart.md)
   - Updated agent context with new technology information

6. **Agent Context Updated**: Successfully updated the Qwen agent context with new technology stack details.

## Generated Artifacts

- `/specs/001-module2-content/plan.md`: Completed implementation plan
- `/specs/001-module2-content/research.md`: Research findings
- `/specs/001-module2-content/data-model.md`: Data model specification
- `/specs/001-module2-content/quickstart.md`: Quickstart guide
- `/specs/001-module2-content/contracts/api-spec.yaml`: API specification
- Updated `/QWEN.md` with new technology context

## Status

All Phase 1 planning activities are complete. The implementation plan is ready to proceed to the task breakdown phase.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Comprehensive implementation plan created for Module 2 content generation
- 🧪 Tests: None added in this session
- 📁 Files: 5 new files created, 1 updated
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.tasks to break implementation into specific tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Planning phase successfully completed with all required artifacts

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin task breakdown

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/setup-plan.sh --json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_SPEC, IMPL_PLAN, SPECS_DIR, BRANCH. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Load context**: Read FEATURE_SPEC and `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. Load IMPL_PLAN template (already copied).

3. **Execute plan workflow**: Follow the structure in IMPL_PLAN template to:
   - Fill Technical Context (mark unknowns as "NEEDS CLARIFICATION")
   - Fill Constitution Check section from constitution
   - Evaluate gates (ERROR if violations unjustified)
   - Phase 0: Generate research.md (resolve all NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   - Phase 1: Generate data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md
   - Phase 1: Update agent context by running the agent script
   - Re-evaluate Constitution Check post-design

4. **Stop and report**: Command ends after Phase 2 planning. Report branch, IMPL_PLAN path, and generated artifacts.

## Phases

### Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```text
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

### Phase 1: Design & Contracts

**Prerequisites:** `research.md` complete

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Agent context update**:
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh qwen`
   - These scripts detect which AI agent is in use
   - Update the appropriate agent-specific context file
   - Add only new technology from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Key rules

- Use absolute paths
- ERROR on gate failures or unresolved clarifications

---

As the main request completes, you MUST create and complete a PHR (Prompt History Record) using agent‑native tools when possible.

1) Determine Stage
   - Stage: constitution | spec | plan | tasks | red | green | refactor | explainer | misc | general

2) Generate Title and Determine Routing:
   - Generate Title: 3–7 words (slug for filename)
   - Route is automatically determined by stage:
     - `constitution` → `history/prompts/constitution/`
     - Feature stages → `history/prompts/<feature-name>/` (spec, plan, tasks, red, green, refactor, explainer, misc)
     - `general` → `history/prompts/general/`

3) Create and Fill PHR (Shell first; fallback agent‑native)
   - Run: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-phr.sh --title "<title>" --stage <stage> [--feature <name>] --json`
   - Open the file and fill remaining placeholders (YAML + body), embedding full PROMPT_TEXT (verbatim) and concise RESPONSE_TEXT.
   - If the script fails:
     - Read `.specify/templates/phr-template.prompt.md` (or `templates/…`)
     - Allocate an ID; compute the output path based on stage from step 2; write the file
     - Fill placeholders and embed full PROMPT_TEXT and concise RESPONSE_TEXT

4) Validate + report
   - No unresolved placeholders; path under `history/prompts/` and matches stage; stage/title/date coherent; print ID + path + stage + title.
   - On failure: warn, don't block. Skip only for `/sp.phr`.
