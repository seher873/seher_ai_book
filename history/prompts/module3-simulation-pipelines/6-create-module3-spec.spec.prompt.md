## Prompt

```
/sp.specify
```

## Response

Created comprehensive specification for Module 3: Simulation and Training Pipelines. The spec includes:

1. Feature branch naming convention
2. User scenarios and testing requirements
3. Functional and non-functional requirements
4. Key entities definition
5. Success criteria with measurable outcomes
6. Clarifications section addressing potential questions

The specification follows the required format with mandatory sections. It defines Module 3 as covering Isaac platform concepts with simulation and training pipelines, targeting a beginner-friendly academic audience with 5 required chapters.

## Outcome

Successfully created a comprehensive specification document for Module 3: Simulation and Training Pipelines covering the NVIDIA Isaac platform, Isaac Sim, synthetic data generation, and Isaac ROS integration with the required 5 chapters structure.

## Evaluation

The specification document includes all mandatory sections, clearly defines user stories with priorities, outlines functional requirements that align with the textbook objectives, and establishes measurable success criteria for Module 3 content.
