## Prompt

```
generate for module 2
```

## Response

Created comprehensive architectural plan for Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity). The plan includes:

1. Scope and dependencies definition
2. Key architectural decisions and rationale
3. Interface specifications for educational content
4. Non-functional requirements (performance, reliability, security)
5. Data management and migration strategy
6. Operational readiness (observability, alerting, runbooks)
7. Risk analysis and mitigation strategies
8. Evaluation and validation criteria
9. Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

The plan addresses all aspects of creating educational content about digital twin concepts using both Gazebo and Unity simulation platforms, with integration to ROS2. It follows academic, beginner-friendly principles while maintaining technical accuracy.

## Outcome

Successfully created a comprehensive architectural plan for Module 2 that covers all required aspects for "The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)" content. The plan balances both simulation platforms, addresses academic requirements, and provides a solid foundation for the educational content implementation.

## Evaluation

The architectural plan is complete and addresses all major aspects of the Module 2 implementation. It includes proper scope definition, risk analysis, operational considerations, and architectural decision records as required for a quality educational module.
