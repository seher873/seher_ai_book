# AI Physics Playground

Welcome to the AI Physics Playground, an interactive environment where you can experiment with physics concepts applied to robotics and artificial intelligence.

## Features

- Interactive physics simulation
- Real-time visualization of robotic movements
- Tools for experimenting with kinematics and dynamics
- Integration with ROS2 for robotics simulation

## Getting Started

Use the playground to run experiments with physical AI concepts. You can:

- Manipulate robot models in a simulated physics environment
- Test control algorithms
- Visualize forces, velocities, and trajectories
- Experiment with sensors in realistic conditions
