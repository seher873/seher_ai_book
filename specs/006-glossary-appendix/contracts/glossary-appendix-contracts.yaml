# API Contracts: Glossary and Appendix B (Reserved: Chatbot/RAG)

**Feature**: 006-glossary-appendix
**Date**: 2025-12-16

## Overview

This feature is implemented as frontend-only content using Markdown files within the Docusaurus documentation system. No API endpoints or backend services are required for this implementation.

The glossary and appendix functionality is achieved through static content and client-side components, which means there are no API contracts to define for this feature.

## Frontend-Only Implementation

All functionality for this feature is:
- Implemented with Markdown content files
- Integrated into the existing Docusaurus documentation structure
- Enhanced with React components for search and navigation
- Deployed as static HTML/CSS/JavaScript assets

## Client-Side Components

The interactive elements (search, navigation) are implemented as client-side React components that work with the static content without requiring server-side APIs.

## Cross-Reference System

Any linking between glossary terms, appendices, and textbook modules is handled through internal Docusaurus linking mechanisms, not API calls.
