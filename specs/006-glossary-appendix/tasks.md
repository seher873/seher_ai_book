# Tasks: Glossary and Appendix B (Reserved: Chatbot/RAG)

**Feature**: Glossary and Appendix B (Reserved: Chatbot/RAG) for the AI textbook
**Branch**: `006-glossary-appendix`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/006-glossary-appendix/spec.md`

**Note**: This document is generated by the `/sp.tasks` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/tasks.md` for the generation workflow.

## Implementation Strategy

MVP scope will focus on User Story 1 (Glossary of Terms) to establish the foundational components and content structure. Subsequent stories will be implemented in priority order (P1, P2, P3...). Each user story includes independent test criteria for validation.

## Dependencies

User stories are largely independent but share common infrastructure components. Foundational tasks include setting up the project structure and content organization. Story dependencies have been minimized to enable parallel development.

## Parallel Execution Examples

Each user story can be developed in parallel after foundational setup tasks are completed. Within each story phase, tasks marked with [P] can be executed in parallel as they work with different files/components.

## Phase 1: Setup

### Goal
Initialize project structure and configuration for the new glossary and appendix components.

- [X] T001 Create content directory structure for glossary and appendices
- [X] T002 Create docs directory structure for glossary and appendices documentation
- [X] T003 Update docusaurus.config.js to include navigation links for glossary and appendices
- [X] T004 Update sidebars.js to include glossary and appendices entries

## Phase 2: Foundational

### Goal
Establish foundational components used across both glossary and appendix user stories.

- [X] T010 [P] Create GlossaryTerm model definition in content/glossary/models/glossary-term.md
- [X] T011 [P] Create AppendixSection model definition in content/appendices/models/appendix-section.md
- [X] T012 [P] Create CrossReference model definition in content/models/cross-reference.md
- [X] T013 [P] Create NavigationLink model definition in content/models/navigation-link.md
- [X] T014 [P] Create glossary content template in content/glossary/glossary-template.md
- [X] T015 [P] Create appendix content template in content/appendices/appendix-template.md
- [X] T016 Create cross-referencing system between content components

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Glossary of Terms Implementation (Priority: P1)

### Goal
As a learner studying the AI textbook, I want a comprehensive glossary of terms so that I can quickly reference and understand key concepts and terminology used throughout the book.

### Independent Test
Can be fully tested by looking up unfamiliar terms in the glossary and finding clear, concise definitions that enhance understanding, delivering improved comprehension of the material.

- [X] T020 [P] [US1] Create glossary index page in docs/glossary/index.md
- [X] T021 [P] [US1] Create glossary A-E terms page in docs/glossary/a-e.md
- [X] T022 [P] [US1] Create glossary F-J terms page in docs/glossary/f-j.md
- [X] T023 [P] [US1] Create glossary K-O terms page in docs/glossary/k-o.md
- [X] T024 [P] [US1] Create glossary P-T terms page in docs/glossary/p-t.md
- [X] T025 [P] [US1] Create glossary U-Z terms page in docs/glossary/u-z.md
- [X] T026 [US1] Create GlossarySearch component in src/components/Glossary/GlossarySearch.jsx
- [X] T027 [US1] Create GlossaryTerm component in src/components/Glossary/GlossaryTerm.jsx
- [X] T028 [US1] Create GlossaryList component in src/components/Glossary/GlossaryList.jsx
- [X] T029 [US1] Add glossary navigation in docs/glossary/sidebar.js
- [X] T030 [US1] Add sample glossary terms for AI concepts

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Appendix B (Reserved: Chatbot/RAG) Implementation (Priority: P2)

### Goal
As a researcher or advanced user of the AI textbook, I want detailed appendices with supplementary material so that I can access additional resources, extended examples, and advanced topics for deeper exploration.

### Independent Test
Can be fully tested by referencing appendix materials and finding the supplementary content that enhances understanding, delivering additional value for advanced learners.

- [X] T040 [P] [US2] Create appendix index page in docs/appendices/index.md
- [X] T041 [P] [US2] Create Appendix B content in docs/appendices/appendix-b-chatbot-rag.md
- [X] T042 [US2] Create AppendixSection component in src/components/Appendix/AppendixSection.jsx
- [X] T043 [US2] Create AppendixNavigation component in src/components/Appendix/AppendixNavigation.jsx
- [X] T044 [US2] Add appendix navigation in docs/appendices/sidebar.js
- [X] T045 [US2] Add comprehensive content about Chatbot and RAG technologies

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Frontend Integration and Navigation (Priority: P3)

### Goal
As a user of the AI textbook, I want to seamlessly navigate between the main content and the glossary/appendices so that I can access supplementary materials without disruption to my learning experience.

### Independent Test
Can be fully tested by navigating between the main content and glossary/appendices without friction, delivering a smooth learning experience.

- [X] T050 [P] [US3] Create NavigationLink component in src/components/Navigation/NavigationLink.jsx
- [X] T051 [P] [US3] Add navigation links from textbook modules to glossary terms
- [X] T052 [P] [US3] Add navigation links from textbook modules to appendices
- [X] T053 [P] [US3] Add navigation links from glossary terms to related modules
- [X] T054 [US3] Add navigation links from appendices to related modules
- [X] T055 [US3] Implement responsive design for glossary and appendices
- [X] T056 [US3] Add accessibility features for glossary and appendices

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Goal
Final integration and polish tasks to ensure all components work together seamlessly.

- [X] T060 [P] Implement search functionality across glossary and appendices
- [X] T061 [P] Add bookmarking functionality for frequently accessed terms/sections
- [X] T062 [P] Create cross-references between related glossary terms and appendix sections
- [X] T063 Add performance optimization for large glossary files
- [X] T064 Update main README.md with documentation about new features
- [X] T065 Create maintenance procedures for glossary quarterly updates
- [X] T066 Perform final integration testing of all components
- [X] T067 Document any performance considerations for page load times
