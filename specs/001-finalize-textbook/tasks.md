# Tasks: Finalize textbook Phase-1

**Feature**: Finalize textbook Phase-1: assessments, lab architecture, hardware alignment, glossary, and appendices
**Branch**: `001-finalize-textbook`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-finalize-textbook/spec.md`

**Note**: This document is generated by the `/sp.tasks` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/tasks.md` for the generation workflow.

## Implementation Strategy

MVP scope will focus on User Story 1 (Textbook Assessments) to establish the foundational components and content structure. Subsequent stories will be implemented in priority order (P1, P2, P3...). Each user story includes independent test criteria for validation.

## Dependencies

User stories are largely independent but share common infrastructure components. Foundational tasks include setting up the project structure and content organization. Story dependencies have been minimized to enable parallel development.

## Parallel Execution Examples

Each user story can be developed in parallel after foundational setup tasks are completed. Within each story phase, tasks marked with [P] can be executed in parallel as they work with different files/components.
